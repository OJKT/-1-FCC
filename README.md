Just another repository, to share with friends and collaborators intrested
<p>I dont know much between the difference or even if there is a differance between kitty ipsum and lorum ipsum... yes im not so smart and clued up on code yet, but as far as i am aware there are many coding languages and theese are two i've never heard before, or am gullable to believe they exist. I have heard of Python and Cali Linux and will hopefully one day learn theese too</p>
<p>CTRL slash / allows me to make this bit un-hidden and hide with as seen as a web developer and not a net browser.
I'm going to attemp to create a NET Bot and other material on my acount... and use it as notes and material for future projects i do to refer back onto

this appears to be working, however it may not open a blank tab (new tab) like prompted to do so.

<p>The link to the bottom doesn't seem to be working, I presume this is a block to internal links, but i am not sure. so i will try and simplify the code.
